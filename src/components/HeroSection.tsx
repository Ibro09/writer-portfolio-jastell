          I am Stella-Jessica, and I am a creative. I am an iGaming writer who
          is passionate about what she does and works towards turning complex
          casino and sports betting topics into content that actually works. I
          know that the gaming industry moves fast, and regulations change
          constantly. To that end, I work closely with SEO teams and developers
          to make sure our content strategy fits the bigger picture and drives
          real business results. Coupled with my content creation abilities, I
          bring the world of gaming and casinos into the limelight with short,
          engaging videos while exploring many other creative endeavors in the
          most exciting ways.
